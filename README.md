This project utilizes a historical invoice and payment transactions dataset from a finance factoring context to explore billing methods, disputes, settlement timing, and payment delays through data analysis and visualization.

The dataset contains information from 2,466 invoices, with invoices issued from January 2012 to December 2013 and payments settled from January 2012 to January 2014. Each record represents a unique invoice, identified by the `invoiceNumber`
